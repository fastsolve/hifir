/*! \page params Control Parameters

\addindex parameters
\tableofcontents

In this section, we discuss control parameters in HIFIR package. To create an
instance of parameter structure, use the following

\code{.cpp}
    auto params = hif::get_default_params();
\endcode

or equivalently

\code{.cpp}
    auto params = hif::DEFAULT_PARAMS;
\endcode

The instance \a params is a C++ structure whose fields are different control
parameters for computing HIF preconditioners. In the following, we will address
commonly-used parameters categorized in different groups.

\section params_basic Essential Parameters

We summary several essential control parameters used in HIF.

- \ref hif::Params::tau_L and \ref hif::Params::tau_U are *drop tolerance* (or
  \a droptol or \f$\tau\f$in short) for L and U factors during fan-in (aka
  Crout-version) ILUs, respectively. The default values are 1e-4 for robustness.
  For most PDE-based systems (i.e., nearly (pattern) symmetric systems), then
  can be increased to 1e-2. In general, we recommend
  \f$\tau\in [10^{-4},10^{-2}]\f$.
- \ref hif::Params::alpha_L and \ref hif::Params::alpha_U are *fill-in factors*
  for *scalability-oriented dropping* for L and U, respectively. The default
  values are 10 for robustness. For 3D PDE systems, \f$\alpha=3\f$ usually works
  very well. For 2D PDE systems, \f$\alpha=5\f$ works well. In general, we
  recommend \f$\alpha\in [2,20]\f$.
- \ref hif::Params::kappa_d and \ref hif::Params::kappa are
  \a conditioning \a thresholds for D and L/U factors, respectively. Their
  default values are 3, which can be enlarged to 5 for efficiency for most
  PDE-based systems, i.e., \f$\kappa\in [3,5]\f$.
- \ref hif::Params::dense_thres controls the final Schur complement size, which
  by default is 2000. Note that the final Schur complement may be larger than
  this threshold, but it plays the most important role in determing the final
  Schur complement sizes. The default value 2000 is for robustness, especially
  for highly assymetric ill-conditioned systems. In general, 500 is sufficient
  for most PDE-based systems.

In summary, for relatively well-posed PDE-based systems, we recommend the
following settings

\code{.cpp}
    auto params = hif::DEFAULT_PARAMS;
    params.tau_L = params.tau_U = 1e-2; // droptol
    params.alpha_L = params.alpha_U = 3; // fill-in factor
    params.kappa_d = params.kappa = 5; // conditioning
    params.dense_thres = 500;
\endcode

\section params_system System Parameters

- \ref hif::Params::verbose controls the verbose levels during factorizations.
  By default, \ref hif::VERBOSE_INFO is enabled. A new level can be enabled via
  bit-wise add options, e.g., `params.verbose |= hif::VERBOSE_PRE` also enables
  verbose information for preprocessing steps. To disbale verbose printing, set
  the verbose level to \ref hif::VERBOSE_NONE.
- \ref hif::Params::threads controls the parallel threads for computing Schur
  complements. The default value is 0, which inherits the setting from the
  system via envrionment variable `OMP_NUM_THREADS` or function
  `omp_get_max_threads`.

\section params_adv Advanced Parameters

In this section, we address some advanced parameters, which may become useful.

- \ref hif::Params::rrqr_cond controls the condition number threshold for
  truncating QRCP for the final Schur complement. The default value is
  \f$\epsilon_{\textrm{mach}}^{-2/3}\f$. For some extremely
  ill-conditioned but not singular systems, we may need to enlarge it.
- \ref hif::Params::beta is the safeguard for preventing abnormally large or
  small scaling factors from equilibration. The default value is 1000.
- \ref hif::Params::pivot controls the dynamic pivoting strategies. By default,
  it is set to be \ref hif::PIVOTING_AUTO, which automatically switches to use
  inverse-based rook pivoting in fan-in ILUs for the coarse levels if necessary.
  To enforce using or disable rook pivoting, use \ref hif::PIVOTING_ON and
  \ref hif::PIVOTING_OFF, respectively.

\section params_pre Preprocessing Parameters

- \ref hif::Params::reorder is for choosing different fill-reduction reordering
  schemes, and we use AMD (\ref hif::REORDER_AMD) by default for its robustness.
  Other options \ref hif::REORDER_RCM and \ref hif::REORDER_AUTO are available.
- \ref hif::Params::symm_pre_lvls controls number of levels for performing
  symmetric preprocessing. Let \f$ T=\textrm{symm\_pre\_lvls}\f$. If \f$ T\ge 0\f$,
  then we always perform exactly \f$ T\f$ levels of symmetric preprocessing.
  If \f$ T<0\f$, then we perform **at most** \f$\vert T\vert\f$ levels of
  symmetric preprocessing. For the latter, in particular, if the inputs of all
  levels are nearly pattern symmetric, then symmetric preprocessing is used for
  these levels. As far as "near pattern symmetry," the following parameter is
  used to control it. By default, \f$ T=-2\f$.
- \ref hif::Params::nzp_thres controls the nonzero pattern (nzp) symmetry
  threshold, which is then used to determine near pattern symmetry. By default,
  it is 0.65, i.e., if 65% entries are pattern symmetric, then a symmetric
  preprocessing is used. Note that this parameter is only used if symm_pre_lvls
  is negative.
