\section install_cpp Installation of the C++ interface

The *HIFIR* package is written in C++, and it uses template-based and
header-only programming. Hence, the installation of C++ interface is pretty
straightforward.

To download the latest version of the code, use the command

\code{.sh}
    git clone -b release -â€“depth 1 https://github.com/hifirworks/hifir.git hifir
    cd hifir
\endcode

Use `git pull` to download any new changes that have been added
since `git clone` or last `git pull`. Alternatively,
use `git checkout v[GLOBAL].[MAJOR].[MINOR]` to download a specific version.
Another way is to download the current archive at
<a href="https://github.com/hifirworks/hifir/releases">here</a>.

To install the code, you can simply do the following on a UNIX system

\code{.sh}
    sudo cp -r src/* /usr/local/include
\endcode

or copy the source files to any user-level directories, e.g.,

\code{.sh}
    cp -r src/* $HOME/.local/include
\endcode

and then add `-I$HOME/.local/include` to the command line of your C++ compiler.

\section install_c Installation of the C library (libhifir)

After obtaining the C++ interface, one can (optionally) install the C
library *libhifir*. First, navigate to the subfolder libhifir

\code{.sh}
    cd libhifir
\endcode

Then, follow the standard workflow of *autotools*

\code{.sh}
    autoreconf -vfi
    ./configure --prefix=PREFIX --with-openmp
    make -j2
    make install
\endcode

If you have customized installations of BLAS and/or LAPACK,
use `--with-blas=<lib>` and `--with-lapack=<lib>` during `configure` stage.
Also, if you don't have OpenMP (which is used in computing Schur complements),
then set `--without-openmp`.
