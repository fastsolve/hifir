Introduction
------------

\c HIFIR is a C++ package for efficient implementation of hybrid incomplete
factorizations with nearly linear time complexity in both its factorization and
triangular solves.

Contacts
--------

The package development is led
by <a href="http://www.ams.sunysb.edu/~jiao/">Prof. Xiangmin (Jim) Jiao</a> with
main developer(s) Dr. Qiao Chen.
