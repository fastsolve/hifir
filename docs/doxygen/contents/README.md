# Customized Pages #

We shall follow the official Doxygen examples that can be found [here](https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen/tree/master/doc). In addition, check the result pages [here](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/index.html).

**To enforce the order of customized pages, we need to explicitly add the page files under `INPUT` in file `Doxyfile.cfg` with the preferred order.**
