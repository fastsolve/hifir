## Introduction ##

Welcome to the `HIFIR` package! `HIFIR` stands for `H`ybrid `I`ncomplete `F`actorization with `I`terative `R`efinement, which is a *multilevel* preconditioner for ill-conditioned and (nearly) singular systems. `HIFIR` has (near) linear time complexity in its factorization and solve and is robust due to its multilevel structure, scalability-oriented dropping, and careful control of the condition numbers of the triangular factors.

## Installation ##

To download the latest version of the code, use the command

```console
git clone -b release -â€“depth 1 https://github.com/hifirworks/hifir.git hifir
```

Use `git pull` to download any new changes that have been added since `git clone` or last `git pull`. Alternatively, use `git checkout v[GLOBAL].[MAJOR].[MINOR]` to download a specific version.

Another way is to download the current archive at [v0.1.0](https://github.com/hifirworks/hifir/releases/tag/v0.1.0).

The C++ interface of `HIFIR` is header-only. To install the code, you can simply do the following on a UNIX system

```console
sudo cp -r /path/to/hifir/src/* /usr/local/include
```

or copy `/path/to/hifir/src/*` to any user-level directory, for example,

```console
cp -r /path/to/hifir/src/* $HOME/.local/include
```

and then add `-I$HOME/.local/include` to the command line of your `C++` compiler.
