## Introduction ##

Welcome to the `HIFIR` package! `HIFIR` stands for `H`ybrid `I`ncomplete `F`actorization with `I`terative `R`efinement, which is a *multilevel* preconditioner for ill-conditioned and (nearly) singular systems. `HIFIR` has (near) linear time complexity in its factorization and solve and is robust due to its multilevel structure, scalability-oriented dropping, and careful control of the condition numbers of the triangular factors.

Detailed documentation of HIFIR can be found at [https://hifirworks.github.io/hifir](https://hifirworks.github.io/hifir).

## Installation ##

To download the latest version of the code, use the command

```console
git clone -b release -â€“depth 1 https://github.com/hifirworks/hifir.git hifir
```

Use `git pull` to download any new changes that have been added since `git clone` or last `git pull`. Alternatively, use `git checkout v[GLOBAL].[MAJOR].[MINOR]` to download a specific version.

Another way is to download the current archive at [https://github.com/hifirworks/hifir/releases](https://github.com/hifirworks/hifir/releases).

The C++ interface of `HIFIR` is header-only. To install the code, you can simply do the following on a UNIX system

```console
sudo cp -r /path/to/hifir/src/* /usr/local/include
```

or copy `/path/to/hifir/src/*` to any user-level directory, for example,

```console
cp -r /path/to/hifir/src/* $HOME/.local/include
```

and then add `-I$HOME/.local/include` to the command line of your `C++` compiler.

### Installation of `libhifir` ###

After obtaining the C++ interface, one can (optionally) install the C library `libhifir`. First, navigate to the subfolder libhifir

```console
cd libhifir
```

Then, install the package using the following procedure

```console
make -j
make PREFIX=/path/to/destination install
```

`-j` can benefit the build process, as it allows building both 32-bit integer
and 64-bit integer verions as the same time. By default, `PREFIX=/usr/local`. In addition, set USE_OPENMP=0 to disable OpenMP, i.e., `make USE_OPENMP=0 -j`, and modify `LAPACK_LIBS` if you have customized installation of LAPACK, i.e., `make LAPACK_LIBS="-L/path/to/openblas/lib -lopenblas" -j`; it is also preferable to set `LDFLAGS=-Wl,-rpath,/path/to/openblas/lib` before compilation. Note that `LAPACK_LIBS="-llapack -lblas"` by default.

Once the installation is finished, we have

- `${PREFIX}/include/libhifir.h`: This is the header file.
- `${PREFIX}/lib/libhifir_i32.{so,a}`: These are shared and static libraries for 32-bit integer builds.
- `${PREFIX}/lib/libhifir_i64.{so,a}`: These are shared and static libraries for 64-bit integer builds.

In order to use 64bit library, set `-DLIBHIFIR_INT_SIZE=64` while compiling your program, i.e., `cc -DLIBHIFIR_INT_SIZE=64 my_prog.c -lhifir_i64`.
