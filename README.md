# Multilevel ILU for Pre-dominantly Symmetric Systems (*PS-MILU*) #

## Introduction ##

Welcome to `PSMILU` package! The *pre-dominantly symmetric multilevel ILU* is an efficient yet robust and powerful preconditioner method for linear solvers. With the optimal time complexity, it can solve large scale problems with ease.
