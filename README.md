## Introduction ##

Welcome to the `HIFIR` package! `HIFIR` stands for `H`ybrid `I`ncomplete `F`actorization with `I`terative `R`efinement, which is a *multilevel* preconditioner for ill-conditioned and (nearly) singular systems. `HIFIR` has (near) linear time complexity in its factorization and solve and is robust due to its multilevel structure, scalability-oriented dropping, and careful control of the condition numbers of the triangular factors.

Detailed documentation of HIFIR can be found at [https://hifirworks.github.io/hifir](https://hifirworks.github.io/hifir).

## Installation ##

To download the latest version of the code, use the command

```console
git clone -b release -â€“depth 1 https://github.com/hifirworks/hifir.git hifir
```

Use `git pull` to download any new changes that have been added since `git clone` or last `git pull`. Alternatively, use `git checkout v[GLOBAL].[MAJOR].[MINOR]` to download a specific version.

Another way is to download the current archive at [https://github.com/hifirworks/hifir/releases](https://github.com/hifirworks/hifir/releases).

The C++ interface of `HIFIR` is header-only. To install the code, you can simply do the following on a UNIX system

```console
sudo cp -r /path/to/hifir/src/* /usr/local/include
```

or copy `/path/to/hifir/src/*` to any user-level directory, for example,

```console
cp -r /path/to/hifir/src/* $HOME/.local/include
```

and then add `-I$HOME/.local/include` to the command line of your `C++` compiler.

Optionally, one can consider using the runtime library `libhifir`; see the [README](./libhifir/README.md) therein for more details.

### Installation of LAPACK ###

HIFIR uses LAPACK for its dense level factorization and solve. For system administrators, we recommend using [OpenBLAS](https://www.openblas.net/) and Intel MKL. To install OpenBLAS using APT repository

```console
sudo apt install libopenblas-dev
```

and

```console
sudo yum install libopenblas-devel
```

for YUM repository. For MKL, we refer readers to [https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/installing-intel-free-libs-and-python-apt-repo.html](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/installing-intel-free-libs-and-python-apt-repo.html) and [https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/installing-intel-free-libs-and-python-yum-repo.html](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/installing-intel-free-libs-and-python-yum-repo.html) for installation using APT and YUM repositories, respectively.

For other platforms (including non-Linux systems and different hardware architectures), we recommend installing OpenBLAS from the source; see [[installation guide](https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/wiki/Installation-Guide](https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/wiki/Installation-Guide) and [https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/wiki/Installation-Guide](https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/wiki/Installation-Guide).
